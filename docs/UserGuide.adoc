== Introduction
Delivery is targeted at restaurants, especially for the small-medium ones, which want to have a system to keep track customers’ orders and delivery.

A restaurant can have hundreds of orders a day and it’s extremely troublesome for the restaurant stuff to manually write down all customer information (including their names, contact numbers, addresses, orders and expected time of delivery etc.) and keep track on it.

Hence, they need a software to store all the information mentioned above in an organised manner.

Delivery is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing orders*. More importantly, Delivery is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Delivery can manage the orders faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `delivery.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the database of customers' personal particulars.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all orders
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 o/chicken rice` : adds an order of chicken rice from customer `John Doe` to the queue.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd order shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Each command has an alias as the shortcut for advanced users to execute commands faster. +
   (e.g. for the "add" command, you can either type "add" or "a")
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
